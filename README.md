Future work: Incorporate OpenCV for image effects/filters, use bootstrap to create a comic book layout to allow more customization for each comic book cell. Create buttons to play audio instead of just autoplay, which will allow user to play each cell individually instead of just having a single jpeg. Add a parent navivagation bar that will allow a person to switch to a specific comic book. Overall additions that will enhance the overlook and user interactivity.
