Instructions for contributing code
Before making any changes, I suggest making sure your local main is up to date by following steps 4-7.

#1 Create your branch (replace "my_branch" with your name or the feature you're adding).
git checkout -b my_branch

#2 Once you've made your changes, go ahead and stage them.
git add .

#3 Commit your changes and choose a meaningful message summarizing what your changed (replace "commit message" below with your message).
git commit -m "commit message"

#4 Checkout to main branch.
git checkout main

#5 Update your local main branch.
git pull

#6 Switch to your branch (substitute "my_branch" below with whatever you named your branch).
git checkout my_branch

#7 Bring your branch up to date with main.
git rebase main

#8 Push your changes to your remote branch (remember to replace "my_branch" with your branch name).
git push origin my_branch

Once you see your branch has updated on Github, create a pull request and ask someone to review your code.
After approved, merge your branch and you're done.
